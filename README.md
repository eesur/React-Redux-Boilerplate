# React with Redux Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is forked from [buckyrobert's React-Redux-Boilerplate](https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Redux-Boilerplate)

It has been changed/tweaked to:

- separate out the components as mentioned in Bucks video tutorials
- use [stateless components](https://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2017/03/functional-stateless-components-react/)
- removed Sass, replaced with [Rebass](http://jxnblk.com/rebass/) styled-components)
- use Bill Murry as the image [placeholders](http://www.fillmurray.com/) :)
